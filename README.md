Simple logger and plotter for Thyracont Smartline devices.

The official Thyracont software uses an old protocol version.  This runs with a new protocol version, for which the specification is available, for example on [GitHub](https://github.com/PedroRossa98/Thyracont_VSR53USB/blob/main/man_vsr-USB-220101.pdf).

There exists another exhaustive, but seemingly untested version of this protocol in [IFAEControl/pyvsr53dl](https://github.com/IFAEControl/pyvsr53dl).
